# Global Company Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective

## Questions 
- 1.Why do sales consistently drop in July and October? Is it related to the Sales Incentive settlement or the fiscal year-end of customers?
- 2.Why did sales increase in November and December, but total profit did not grow accordingly? Was it due to discounts, rising shipping costs, or increased raw material expenses?
- 3.Why did the Furniture category experience rapid sales growth in 2015, yet its profit decreased? Was it due to higher costs or excessive discounts?
- 4.Which regions experienced the highest sales growth? Since the US (USCA) saw the most growth from October to November 2013, how can we further expand this market?
- 5.Which sales representatives contributed the most to sales growth? Are there specific sales strategies or techniques worth replicating?
- 6.Sales grew by 48% in Q4 2015, but growth was limited in June. Can strategies be adjusted to achieve more balanced sales growth throughout the year?
