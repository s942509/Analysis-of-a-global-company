# Global Company Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI)
## Project Objective
The company aims to analyze its performance trends, identify the causes of business fluctuations through annual and monthly trend analysis, and optimize procurement and sales strategies. This will help ensure stable cash flow and drive business growth in the coming years.
## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/s942509/Analysis-of-a-global-company/blob/main/Global%20Superstore%20Orders%202016.xlsx">Global Superstore Orders 2016.xlsx</a>

## Questions 
- 1.Why do sales consistently drop in July and October? Is it related to the Sales Incentive settlement or the fiscal year-end of customers?
- 2.Why did sales increase in November and December, but total profit did not grow accordingly? Was it due to discounts, rising shipping costs, or increased raw material expenses?
- 3.Why did the Furniture category experience rapid sales growth in 2015, yet its profit decreased? Was it due to higher costs or excessive discounts?
- 4.Which regions experienced the highest sales growth? Since the US (USCA) saw the most growth from October to November 2013, how can we further expand this market?
- 5.Which sales representatives contributed the most to sales growth? Are there specific sales strategies or techniques worth replicating?
- 6.Sales grew by 48% in Q4 2015, but growth was limited in June. Can strategies be adjusted to achieve more balanced sales growth throughout the year?

## Project Insights
- Sales consistently drop in July and October, likely due to Sales Incentive settlements or fiscal year-end effects.=>Align procurement and sales strategies with seasonal demand fluctuations to maintain stable revenue.
- Sales increase significantly in November and December, but total profit does not rise proportionally.=>
Potential causes include heavy discounting, increased shipping costs, or higher raw material expenses.
- Despite rapid sales growth in 2015, the Furniture category experienced declining profit.=>
Investigate whether discounts, rising costs, or inefficient pricing strategies contributed to lower margins.
- The US (USCA) had significant sales growth from October to November 2013, followed by Latin America.=>
Identifying successful sales strategies in high-growth regions can help expand market share.

- While Q4 2015 saw strong growth (+48% in November), June sales remained stagnant.=>Implementing targeted marketing campaigns and demand forecasting can distribute sales growth more evenly throughout the year.
  
## Final Conclusion
The data analysis reveals clear seasonal trends and profitability challenges, particularly in Q4 and specific product categories. While sales are growing year over year, fluctuations in cash flow and profit margins highlight the need for better cost control, optimized discounting strategies, and regional expansion planning. By addressing these insights, the company can enhance financial stability and maximize long-term growth.
