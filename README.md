## Questions (KPIs)
- 1.Sales Seasonality Changes
- Why do sales consistently drop in July and October? Is it related to the Sales Incentive settlement or the fiscal year-end of customers?
- 2.Q4 Sales vs. Profit Relationship
- Why did sales increase in November and December, but total profit did not grow accordingly? Was it due to discounts, rising shipping costs, or increased raw material expenses?
- 3.Declining Profit in Specific Product Categories
- Why did the Furniture category experience rapid sales growth in 2015, yet its profit decreased? Was it due to higher costs or excessive discounts?
- 4.Regional Sales Performance Analysis
- Which regions experienced the highest sales growth? Since the US (USCA) saw the most growth from October to November 2013, how can we further expand this market?
- 5.Sales Personnel Performance Evaluation
- Which sales representatives contributed the most to sales growth? Are there specific sales strategies or techniques worth replicating?
- 6.Annual and Monthly Sales Trends
- Sales grew by 48% in Q4 2015, but growth was limited in June. Can strategies be adjusted to achieve more balanced sales growth throughout the year?
